##  Project Demonstration Video
This project simulates the working of a real-world microwave oven using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. It implements Micro, Grill, Convection, and Quick Start modes with realistic behavior such as magnetron cooling, heater pre-heating, time-based cooking, buzzer alerts, and safe state transitions. The system is implemented using Embedded C with an interrupt-driven architecture and is simulated using MPLAB X IDE and PICSimLab.

A complete simulation and working demonstration of this project is available on YouTube:
